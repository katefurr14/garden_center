    <h2>Tips & Tricks </h2>

    <p> Not everyone has a natural knack for gardening, but these tips and tricks with planting can help level the field and get your garden blooming like a pro's. Some of these are commonly known, but still incredibly useful, like the Do-It-Yourself Watering Can, while others are more obscurely known.</p>


  <h3><i>Eggshell Fertilizer</i></h3>
  <p> Surprisingly, eggshells are very healthy for a garden's plant inhabitants. Spread the shells around the bases of your plants. These eggshells will provide nourishing calcium, as well as keep some insects repelled.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Coffee Fertilizer</i></h3>
  <p> Coffee can be used as a fertilizer, just like the eggshells mentioned above. It adds nutrients to the earth and increases drainage of the soil. It also adds a pleasant aroma to your garden.</p>

  <h3><i>DIY Watering Can</i></h3>
   <p> Many people use an empty milk jug as a watering can, especially for plants in a limited area (like a porch or deck). You are also recycling by reusing the container, so good on you!</p>
   

    <h3><i>DIY Drip Feeder</i></h3>
    <p> This is especially helpful for plants (namely vegetables) that need moisture in the roots rather than overhead, like a hose bath. This drip feeder can be made with a plastic water bottle that you've punctured with holes. You will bury the bottle next to your plant, leaving the opening to the air (this is very important). Pour water into the bottle through the opening to water your plant. </p>
